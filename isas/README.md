iSASv2
======
This is second version of my access simplifying app for our school's website


Used libraries
==============
* Android Annotations
* Appcompat
* Torch

#IMPORTANT - for future maintainer
##TODO
* Ask school IT to create API, with json files - there need to be 2 files on their server,
 publicly accessible, one for teachers and one for classes
* change links to these files, right now the app is loading data from my github.io
* change package of the app, this one is just terrible because of it's length
* check if isas's url structure has changed and fix it
* update all libraries especially appcompat

**Feel free to contact me for any help, I'll be glad that someone wants to continue this app**
